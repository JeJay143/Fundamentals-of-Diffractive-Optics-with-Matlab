# Physics Simulations in MATLAB

## Overview
This repository contains MATLAB scripts for simulating various physical phenomena. These scripts serve as educational tools to demonstrate fundamental principles in physics through computational simulations.

## Newton-Raphson's Method
This MATLAB script implements the Newton-Raphson's Method to find the root of a given equation. The user is prompted to enter an initial guess value, and the script iteratively refines this guess until it converges to a solution within a specified tolerance.

## Basic Plotting
This part of the script demonstrates basic plotting functionalities in MATLAB. Three sinusoidal functions (`sin(2*pi*x)`, `cos(2*pi*x)`, and their sum) are plotted over a specified range of `x` values.

## Interference of Coherent Beams
The interaction between two coherent beams at a screen is known as interference. A beam is called coherent when the phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or times is fixed. Young's double-slit experiment creates two beams by splitting a single beam.

## Usage
1. Run the MATLAB scripts in your MATLAB environment.
2. Follow the instructions provided in each script to interact with the simulations.
