# Newton-Raphson's Method and Basic Plotting in MATLAB

## Overview
This README provides an overview of the Newton-Raphson's Method script and basic plotting functionalities implemented in MATLAB.

## Newton-Raphson's Method
This MATLAB script implements the Newton-Raphson's Method to find the root of a given equation. The user is prompted to enter an initial guess value, and the script iteratively refines this guess until it converges to a solution within a specified tolerance.

## Basic Plotting
This part of the script demonstrates basic plotting functionalities in MATLAB. Three sinusoidal functions (`sin(2*pi*x)`, `cos(2*pi*x)`, and their sum) are plotted over a specified range of `x` values.

## Usage
1. Run the MATLAB script `newton_raphson.m` in your MATLAB environment.
2. Enter an appropriate initial guess value when prompted for Newton-Raphson's Method.
3. The script will calculate the root of the given equation and display the result.
4. Basic plotting functionalities will generate a plot showing the sine and cosine functions, as well as their sum, over the specified range of `x` values.
